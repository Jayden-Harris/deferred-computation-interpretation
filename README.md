# The Deferred-Computation Interpretation (DCI) of Quantum Mechanics

## Overview

**The Deferred-Computation Interpretation (DCI)** is a speculative framework that treats the quantum layer of reality as a **computational substrate** in which events are evaluated only when required for consistency.  
It does not claim empirical proof; it offers a **conceptual bridge** between quantum theory, information theory, and computational metaphors.

DCI extends ideas explored in *[Simulation Theory — Reality as Computation](../)* and proposes a coherent vocabulary for viewing quantum behaviour as *lazy evaluation within a universal program.*

## Core Premise

Reality can be modelled as an ongoing computation.  
Quantum states represent **deferred data structures**—compact superpositions of potential outcomes that remain unrendered until observation or interaction demands a concrete value.  
Measurement corresponds to a **write operation** that commits one outcome to the shared “memory” of the universe.

## Postulates

1. **Deferred Representation (Superposition)**  
   A quantum system encodes multiple potential states, analogous to a variable held in memory whose value is not yet computed.

2. **Triggering Event (Measurement)**  
   Observation acts as a request for data; the system resolves one outcome consistent with global informational balance.

3. **Entropy as Rendering Cost**  
   Each resolution disperses phase information into the environment.  
   Entropy measures the computational cost of maintaining coherence after an event.

4. **Born Rule as Equilibrium Constraint**  
   Apparent randomness reflects a balancing protocol ensuring statistical equilibrium across many trials.

5. **Emergent Classicality**  
   Macroscopic stability arises from continuous synchronization (decoherence) of locally rendered results—reality’s shared database.

## Conceptual Mapping

| Quantum Concept | Computational Analogue | Interpretive Meaning |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Wavefunction | Stored data structure | Encoded potentials |
| Measurement | Write operation | Selection of concrete outcome |
| Decoherence | Data synchronization | Agreement among observers |
| Entropy Increase | Processing cost | Price of definiteness |
| Born Rule | Normalization protocol | Statistical equilibrium |

## Philosophical Character

- **Ontological stance:** informational realism / neutral monism  
- **Epistemic stance:** participatory—observers are active processes within the computation  
- **Testability:** conceptual coherence, not empirical prediction  
- **Goal:** a language that unites physics, computation, and consciousness under a single interpretive lens

## Relationship to Other Interpretations

DCI intersects with ideas from:
- **Copenhagen & QBism** – observation as information update  
- **Many-Worlds** – parallel potential states, selectively rendered  
- **Relational QM** – properties exist only through interaction  
- **Digital Physics** – universe as discrete information process
